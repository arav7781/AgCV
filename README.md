## Overview

**AgCV** is an innovative agentic framework designed to democratize computer vision (CV) automation by enabling users to perform complex CV tasks through simple natural language instructions. By leveraging advanced AI, natural language processing (NLP), and modular vision systems, AgCV translates user queries into executable Python code, runs it via an integrated REPL tool, and delivers real-time visualizations.

## What is AgCV?

AgCV allows users to input intuitive commands, such as:  
- "Convert the image into a grayscale image and apply edge detection algorithm"  

The framework then:  
- Converts the query into executable Python code.  
- Executes the code using an integrated REPL environment.  
- Displays the results with real-time visualizations.

## Core Features

- **LangGraph-Driven Task Orchestration**: Utilizes LangGraph for seamless coordination of agentic AI workflows.  
- **Hybrid RAG System**: Combines keyword-based and semantic search for robust retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
- **Modular Vision Block System**: Supports dynamic pipelines for object detection, classification, and segmentation through agent-based design.  
- **NLP-Powered Interpretation**: Employs large language models (LLMs) for human-like understanding of user queries.  
- **Real-Time Visualizations**: Provides immediate visual feedback for processed outputs.

## Demo

🎥 An early prototype of AgCV, built with a Streamlit UI, is showcased in the [demo video](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016124003498?via%3Dihub). Recent enhancements and UI upgrades are under active development.

## Installation

> **Note**: Detailed installation instructions will be added once the framework is publicly released. For now, refer to the [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016124003498?via%3Dihub) for implementation details.

## Usage

1. **Input a Query**: Provide a natural language instruction, e.g., "Apply edge detection to an image."  
2. **Code Generation**: AgCV translates the query into Python code using LLMs and LangChain.  
3. **Execution**: The code is executed in a REPL environment.  
4. **Visualization**: Results are displayed with real-time visualizations.
